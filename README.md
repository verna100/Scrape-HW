**NYPost News Scraper**

**Overview**


In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

To run this program you can git clone:
https://github.com/verna100/Scrape-HW.git

then npm install to install all the needed the dependencies. 

Once installed npm start to run it and it will guide you to http://localhost:3000 for viewing.


**What you can do:**


-Scrape new news articles
-Clear all news articles
-Save articles you want to read later
-Add notes to articles.

This app is depoloyed on heroku and can be accessed here:
