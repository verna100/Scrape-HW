**NYPost News Scraper**

**Overview**


In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

To run this program you can git clone:
https://github.com/verna100/Scrape-HW.git

then npm install to install all the needed the dependencies. 

Once installed npm start to run it and it will guide you to http://localhost:3000 for viewing.


**What you can do:**


-Scrape new news articles (when you press the scrape new articles button it will scrape for new news since the last scrape. Go to Home to see the new articles displayed)
-Clear all news articles
-Save articles you want to read later
-Add notes to articles.

This app is depoloyed on heroku and can be accessed here:
