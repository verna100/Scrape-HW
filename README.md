NYPost News Scraper

Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

To run this program you can git clone:
https://github.com/verna100/Scrape-HW.git

then npm install to install all the needed the dependencies. 

Once installed npm start to run it.


What you can do:
-Scrape new news articles
-Clear all news articles
-Save articles you want to read later
-Add notes to articles.

This app is depoloyed on heroku and can be accessed here: 





I sincerely appreciate the effort that you made fleshing out the README file - but it's missing three very important pieces - how do I set up the app? (npm install) how do I run it? (npm start) how do I access it? ("navigate to localhost:XXXX in your browser")
